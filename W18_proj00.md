Answer these questions and delete them as we go

(a) This project allows the user to play the game battleship against a computer, or online via java networking.

(b) As a user, I can start the game and choose to play locally or online so that I can play by myself or with someone else.
    As a user, I can choose a color and difficulty so that I can determine which player is me.
    As a user, I can lay out my ships so that I have a choice where my ships are placed
    As a user, I can choose a pixel where to fire a shot so that I can attempt to win the game by my own choices.

(c) The software runs. When the game is opened, there is a choice of opponent type (online or against AI), a choice of color, and a choice of difficulty (if against AI). The user then places his/her ships and then attempts to sink the opponents.

(d) (20 pts) a set of user stories (at least 2, but you are encouraged to write up to 4 or more if you can, as many as you think is reasonable) about features that COULD be added to the software to make it more useful, fun, better, etc.
Again, review the preferred way to write User Stories.

(e) (20 pts) An assessment of the current quality of the README.md. What information could be added to make it easier for the next generation of folks maintaining this code to use the software, and/or maintain the software?

(f) (20 pts) An assessment of the current state of the build.xml file if applicable, or if the project has been converted to Maven or Gradle, note this.
If it’s based on Ant, Are there targets that need descriptions? Is there old legacy JWS stuff that needs to be removed? (More on this below).
It it’s based on Maven or Gradle, is there sufficient documentation in the README.md that someone new to those tools has the information they need to get started?

(g) (20 pts) An assessment of the current “issues”. Are there enough issues that you could earn 1000 points by working on this project? Are the issues clear in terms of what the expectations are?

(h) (20 pts) A list of additional issues that you may have added, if any. For each, a link to the issue is good enough.

(i) (100 pts) Most important: an assessment of the actual code. Write a bit about how the code is organized. Are the purposes of the classes, and their methods clear? Is it obvious how the classes relate to one another? Is the code easy to read and understand? If you had to give someone else that was going to work on the code just “one screenful of text” to help that programmer get up to speed quickly, what information would you convey?

(j) (40 pts) Related to code quality, but factored out into a separate issue because it is so important: how is the test coverage? Are there JUnit tests at all? If so, how much of the project is covered by testing? Are there opportunities to expand test coverage, and if so, how would you go about it?
