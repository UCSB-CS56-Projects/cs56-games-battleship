A player chooses the size of 5 different ships and decides where to place the shits on the grid. The player and the opposing player/computer will take turns to try to sink the other players ships until all the ships are sunk.

Currently the software allows you to choose the size of the ships, ranging from 2 to 9, selecting the difficutly level of the 
computer, selecting the color for the ships, selecting where the ships go on the grid, plays sounds when there is a hit or miss or victory, but this is limited to 30 times on the CSIL machines.
