A player chooses the size of 5 different ships and decides where to place the shits on the grid. The player and the opposing player/computer will take turns to try to sink the other players ships until all the ships are sunk.

Currently the software allows you to choose the size of the ships, ranging from 2 to 9, selecting the difficutly level of the 
computer, selecting the color for the ships, selecting where the ships go on the grid, plays sounds when there is a hit or miss or victory, but this is limited to 30 times on the CSIL machines. 

Running the program was simple and navigating through the menu was easy to follow as well. When we run the program, it first prompts us to choose how we would like to play the game, choosing whether we want to host a game, join a game, or play against the computer. Then the game prompts us to choose the color of our ships and sizes of our ships. We then get into the GUI and are allowed to place our ships in any part of the grid in any valid position that we want. We then play the game as normal. 

As a user, I can select whether I want to host a game or join someone else's game using their IP address, or I can play alone against the computer. I can choose the size of my ships and place them anywhere I want them and what orientation they are on the grid. If I am going against the computer, I can choose the difficulty setting of the computer. In the game, I can choose which coordinate the enemy ship is at, and be notified if I guessed correctly or not. I am also notified if my ships are hit as well. 

Possible changes: 

* Changing the GUI to match the real-life game more
* Improving the sound effects of the game and adding background music 
* Adding different shapes and sizes for the boats 
* Improving the computer opponent 
* Adding a separate file for the test cases and cleaning up existing tests, if any

As a user I would change the GUI of the program in order for the game to be mor real life. Currently it is just a grid of squares that changes color if its a hit or miss. Pictures of ships could be added in place of the ships to make it more life-like. As a user I would want to play against more than one person. I would want to be able to face more than one opponent or play against more than one friend. I would also like to see the soundeffects and sounds in the game to be more consistent and line up more with their actions. Currently the sounds don't match what the current actions are. 

The current README.md is excellent. The quality of information provided and screenshots of the actual program helped us understand the program function relatively easily. One thing that could be changed is the formatting, such as showing the figures right after it is reference initially and to show where each section began/ended more obviously. Perhaps to bold the sections using #.

The targets in the build.xml file all have descriptions that describe what is going on at that target. There are no old JWS things that needs to be removed.

The currents issues of the program are adding test coverage/cleaning up test cases, adding annotations to the javadoc, adding background music, fixing the sound effects, revamping the GUI, and allowing users more room to make mistakes when setting up the game. I think there are enough issues in the program for us to improve upon since revamping the GUI probably means rebuilding the GUI from the bottom up in order to make it more like the real life battleship board game. The issues are clear in what is expected in order for us to clear the issue.

The only additional issue which we encountered was that the sfx was not aligned with the program. It would play fine at times but sometimes it would not work. The issue could be that we were clicking the squares too fast and the program didn't have time to register.

The code is organized in into 4 subfolders in the src file. Each folder describes a part of the game like Controller, which is the list of controllers for the program, or sfx, which is all the sound effects for the program. The purpose of the classes and methods are clear and are obvious how they are related to each other. However, some of the methods are confusing to understand at first if the programmer reading it did not read the whole file before trying to understand the code. The information I would convey to the programmer to get up to speed with the code is to read all the .java files twice, once to familiarize them with the methods and the second time to see how the methods are connected. The issues with the code are mainly UI and testing more than the actual game, since the game itself runs fine. There are details like the sfx don't match or don't work at times but most of the issues are with the GUI/UI.

There is no test coverage that is obvious. There is a JUnit file but there are not JUnit test. The main oppurtunity to expand test coverage is when the user isn't punish for making a mistake when creating a game. There could be a lot of test cases for all the possible things the users does when creating a game and making a mistake.
