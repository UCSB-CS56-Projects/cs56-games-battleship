A player chooses the size of 5 different ships and decides where to place the shits on the grid. The player and the opposing player/computer will take turns to try to sink the other players ships until all the ships are sunk.

Currently the software allows you to choose the size of the ships, ranging from 2 to 9, selecting the difficutly level of the 
computer, selecting the color for the ships, selecting where the ships go on the grid, plays sounds when there is a hit or miss or victory, but this is limited to 30 times on the CSIL machines. 

#running program

Possible changes 

* Changing the GUI to match the real-life game more
* 

The current README.md is excellent. The quality of information provided and screenshots of the actual program helped us understand the program function relatively easily. One thing that could be changed is the formatting, such as showing the figures right after it is reference initially and to show where each section began/ended more obviously. Perhaps to bold the sections using #.
